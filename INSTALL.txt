PREREQUISITES
=============

The HoTT library requires a version of Coq which supports the command-line options
`-relevant-equality` and `-warn-universe-inconsistencies`. The first one changes the
interpretation of equality to one that conforms to the homotopy-theoretic interpretation,
while the second one is an ugly temporary hack that turns universe inconsistencies
intro warning rather than errors.

At present only a fork of the Coq trunk supports these options, but we hope to get them
into the official Coq soon. Unfortunately for you that means you will have to compile a
version of Coq, available at

   https://github.com/HoTT/coq

If you have never compiled Coq you may prefer to ask a friend for help. But basically,
here are the instructions:

1. Obtain the Coq fork. If you have the `git` command, you can do

   git clone https://github.com/HoTT/coq.git

   If you do not have git you may download coq as a ZIP file at https://github.com/HoTT/coq/zipball/trunk.

2. Compile Coq, as explained in the INSTALL.txt file of Coq distribution.
   You will need some prerequisites for compilation, such as Ocaml 3.11.2 or later.

3. Install Coq so that it can be found in your PATH.

4. Test that you have the correct Coq version. The command

   coqtop -help | grep -c -- -relevant-equality

   should print 1. If it prints 0 you got the wrong version of Coq.
