A development of homotopy-theoretic foundations of mathematics in the Coq
proof assistant.

This is the repository for the Coq files of the [Homotopy Type Theory
project](http://homotopytypetheory.org/). You can fork this repository to your own and
then be automatically kept up to date on new developments. You can also contribute back
into it by sending a pull request.

Because we have switched to a new version of Coq which supports the homotopy-theoretic
interpretation, the development team is abandoning the version of the library which works
with pure Coq 8.3 and 8.4. We expect that the changes made to Coq will propagate to the
trunk version of Coq fairly quickly, and then to the next Coq release.

If you insist on using a generic Coq 8.3 or 8.4, then you should get this particular
version of the library. Good luck!

See the file INSTALL.txt for installation instructions.
